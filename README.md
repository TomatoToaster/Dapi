This is a pet (haha) project I am working on to try and make a domestic pet using my Raspberry Pi.

Regardless of using a Raspberry Pi, I intend for this to be pronounced like "Dappy" not Dah Pie.

I want this to be open source so that others can add features or maybe even personalize their own pet.

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
